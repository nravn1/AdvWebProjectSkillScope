Few quick notes about the project
How to Run it:
1- Clone or download the repo
2- Run update-database in PM 
(This should build out the database)
3- Build and/or run the solution
(This should use the seeding made to populate the database and add links between entities)
4- Sign up and explore the application!
(A more detailed description on how to navigate through the application is on the ABOUT page in the app)

To test its API functionality:
Either open a new tab or go through postman and send a GET request to "localhost:portnumber/api/skills" 
This should return JSON to you of all the skills in the database

-------------------

SideNote:
When I would run it with the debugger on my work laptop, if I went to see the details of a certain person in the DB, it would crash and show me some weird exception in a hidden bootstrap animation build. If I ran it without the debugge, it would work fine. I also tested this on 2 other laptops with the same exact code and they worked with both so it may be a weird setting in my VS on my work laptop but I digress.

--------------------

I was able to take this application a long way but I want to continue working on it further outside of this class. The fact it could have realworld use is very motivating to me and hope I can keep adding feature after feature onto it.

AI Disclosure:

Model used: GPT 4
Used for: I used AI to help generate fake names and info for my seeding and used it for clarifictaion on CSS properties since I cannot remember many of them for the life of me haha.
What I gained: I gained a stronger understanding of how to apply custom CSS over Bootstrap items and properities. It was very cool to me how you could easy apply bootstrap to areas you wanted but quickly override them when needed by CSS.
