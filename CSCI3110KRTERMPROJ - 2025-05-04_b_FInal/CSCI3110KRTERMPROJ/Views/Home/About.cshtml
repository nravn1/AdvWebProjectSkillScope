            <p>
                The application revolves around four key areas:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Roles:</strong> Define job roles and assign required skills to them.</li>
                <li><strong>Skills:</strong> A catalog of abilities. See which persons and roles possess each skill.</li>
                <li><strong>Privileges:</strong> Access permissions or responsibilities assigned to persons.</li>
            </ul>
